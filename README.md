# List of resources for the hackathon

Different data storage and backup options
Organizing, documenting, and adding metadata to research data to optimize the visibility of your data
Data archiving, access, sharing and re-use with the use of data repositories
Understanding the different copyright licenses designed to deal with open data
    
For an extensive list of resources for Open Science see: [OpenScience MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/resources/#)

## ShareYourCode

### Distributed version control systems (DVCS)
[Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
[Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)  
[GitHub](https://github.com/) - **web-based**  
[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) - **web-based**  

### Web-based executable capsules
[Binder](https://mybinder.org/)  
Turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks  

[CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/)  
Share code and data alongside published articles. Users can view, edit, and run the articleâ€™s code using a web browser.

## ShareYourData
[Registry of research data repository](https://www.re3data.org/)  
Tool to search for the data repository that best fit your data.  

[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) *- Total files size limit per record is 50GB.*  
Publish research in any file format and assign an institutionally-branded DOI.  
Identify grants, integrated in reporting lines for research funded by the European Commission via OpenAIRE.  

[Figshare](https://figshare.com/) *- 5GB default single file limit. The limit can be lifted up to 5TB in size.*  
Publish research in any file format and assign an institutionally-branded DOI.  

## ShareYourFramework
Keep all your files, data, and protocols in one centralized location.  
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)  
[Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)  
[Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/)  
[ReproZip](https://www.reprozip.org/)  

    ReproZip can automatically pack your research along with all necessary data files, libraries, environment variables and options into a self-contained bundle. Then ReproZip can use that bundle to automatically set up the same original environment so anybody can reproduce the research on a different machine, without tracking down and installing the dependencies, or even having to run the same operating system!
