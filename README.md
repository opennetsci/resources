List of resources for the hackathon
You'll learn to establish links between publications data and methods, how to attach a persistent identifier and metadata to your results, and methods for clarifying usage rights. You will also discover ways to apply these principles to your daily research and adapt existing routines. Finally, you'll uncover potential barriers to sharing research and discuss possible solutions. 

This course will help you grasp the key principles of Open Science, with answers to questions like:

    How can researchers effectively store, manage, and share research data?
    What kinds of open access publishing are most effective?
    How can researchers increase the visibility and impact of their research?
    How can the use of social media contribute to the visibility and impact of research?
    
    Learning the disciplinary standards of FAIR data sharing
    Evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of different data storage and backup options
    Organizing, documenting, and adding metadata to research data to optimize the visibility of your data
    Data archiving, access, sharing and re-use with the use of data repositories
    Understanding the different copyright licenses designed to deal with open data
    Dealing with confidential data, company restrictions, and third-party agreements through case studies
    Evaluating a data management plan
    Explaining how Open Data can be applied in your field of research

Zenodo in a nutshell

    Research. Shared. — all research outputs from across all fields of research are welcome! Sciences and Humanities, really!
    Citeable. Discoverable. — uploads gets a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to make them easily and uniquely citeable.
    Communities — create and curate your own community for a workshop, project, department, journal, into which you can accept or reject uploads. Your own complete digital repository!
    Funding — identify grants, integrated in reporting lines for research funded by the European Commission via OpenAIRE.
    Flexible licensing — because not everything is under Creative Commons.
    Safe — your research output is stored safely for the future in the same cloud infrastructure as CERN's own LHC research data.

Simple and FAIR
We make it as simple as possible to make research Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reuasble (FAIR)

    Publish research in any file format and assign an institutionally-branded DOI

    Document with customizable, discipline-specific metadata

    Discoverable content across major search engines and academic frameworks
