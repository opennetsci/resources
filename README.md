# List of resources for the hackathon

What follows is a short list of resources that might come in handy during the hackathon.
It includes: 
1. Version control and code backup options;
2. Services to organize, document, and add metadata to research data to optimize the visibility of your projects;  
3. Tools for data archiving, access, sharing and re-use;
4. Different copyright licenses for open data and software.
    
For an extensive list of resources for Open Science see the list [OpenScience MOOC](https://opensciencemooc.eu/resources/#).
