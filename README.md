[GitHub]()
[Mercury]()

[Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/)

OSF helps individuals, teams and labs make their research processes more efficient.

    View all of your projects from one dashboard.
    Share key project information and allow others to use and cite it.
    See the latest project changes, who is contributing and historical file versions.
    Add others to your projects to collaborate, or provide private access to view.
    Keep all your files, data, and protocols in one centralized location. Secure Cloud
    You control which parts of your project are public or private making it easy to collaborate with the worldwide community or just your team. 
[Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/)  
[ReproZip]()


ReproZip can automatically pack your research along with all necessary data files, libraries, environment variables and options into a self-contained bundle. Then ReproZip can use that bundle to automatically set up the same original environment so anybody can reproduce the research on a different machine, without tracking down and installing the dependencies, or even having to run the same operating system!

## ShareYourCode

[Binder](https://mybinder.org/)
Turn a Git repo into a collection of interactive notebooks
Have a repository full of Jupyter notebooks? With Binder, open those notebooks in an executable environment, making your code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere

## ShareYourData
[Registry of research data repository](https://www.re3data.org/)
[Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)  
Zenodo in a nutshell

    Research. Shared. — all research outputs from across all fields of research are welcome! Sciences and Humanities, really!
    Citeable. Discoverable. — uploads gets a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) to make them easily and uniquely citeable.
    Communities — create and curate your own community for a workshop, project, department, journal, into which you can accept or reject uploads. Your own complete digital repository!
    Funding — identify grants, integrated in reporting lines for research funded by the European Commission via OpenAIRE.
    Flexible licensing — because not everything is under Creative Commons.
    Safe — your research output is stored safely for the future in the same cloud infrastructure as CERN's own LHC research data.

Simple and FAIR
We make it as simple as possible to make research Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reuasble (FAIR)

    Publish research in any file format and assign an institutionally-branded DOI

    Document with customizable, discipline-specific metadata

    Discoverable content across major search engines and academic frameworks
    
[Dryad Digital Repository](http://datadryad.org)
The Dryad Digital Repository is a curated resource that makes the data underlying scientific publications discoverable, freely reusable, and citable. Dryad provides a general-purpose home for a wide diversity of datatypes.

Dryad’s vision is to promote a world where research data is openly available, integrated with the scholarly literature, and routinely re-used to create knowledge.

Our mission is to provide the infrastructure for, and promote the re-use of, data underlying the scholarly literature.

Dryad is governed by a nonprofit membership organization. Membership is open to any stakeholder organization, including but not limited to journals, scientific societies, publishers, research institutions, libraries, and funding organizations.

Publishers are encouraged to facilitate data archiving by coordinating the submission of manuscripts with submission of data to Dryad. Learn more about submission integration.

Dryad originated from an initiative among a group of leading journals and scientific societies in evolutionary biology and ecology to adopt a joint data archiving policy (JDAP) for their publications, and the recognition that easy-to-use, sustainable, community-governed data infrastructure was needed to support such a policy.
